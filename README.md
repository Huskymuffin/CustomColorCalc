# CustomColorCalc
A simple (for people other than me) android calculator app that lets you change the foreground and background colors to any hex color value. This is my first android app I have ever made, and I am 14 years old, so the code is probably not pretty. 

# What is the point?
At first I was just going to make a red and white calculator because I like the Nebraska Cornhuskers, but then I thought, "What if you could change the colors to the colors of ANY sports team? Maybe someone would use it!" So that is what I did.
